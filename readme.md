# This is `Reroot the world` Repo
Roots up is a platformer created for Global Game Jam 2023 in Unity.

The player character tries to revive a apocaliptic city by watering plants to create breathable atmosphere. They can not survive the atmosphere without plants nearby, so they have to find new ones and grow them, to extend their action radius.
